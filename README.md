# A small fun Tic Tac Toe game in flutter

Origin of the project: A contact on Linkedin purposed me to do a Tic Tac Toe game in flutter.  
Even if it was not required to do it, I decided to do it for fun and to learn more about flutter.  
So, i learnt how to manipulate matrix4, to make some animations on actions, and i got some sound effects from the web.  

This project was not a production project, so the interface is not perfect, but it works well.

App is totally made in french, no internationalization was made.

## Run the project
Requirements:    
    - Flutter SDK  
    - Compatible device to run the app on (Android, iOS, Browser, Windows, MacOS, Linux)  

Clone the project, and run `flutter run` in the project folder, that's all.

## Play the game
The home page will show you play buttons, they have a chance to start the game, respectively 100%, 75%, 50%, 25% 0% chance.

The game page will be a simple tic tac toe, 2 buttons on the top will bring you at the home, or reset the game.

The playing player is indicated on top of the game grid.
